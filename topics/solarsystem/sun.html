    <h1>The Sun</h1>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Our Sun is a main-sequence yellow dwarf star – a perfect star for a planetary system with life. The surface of our star is around 5,500°C, with the core being a blazing 15,000,000°C. The age of this great stellar wonder is around 4.6 billion years old, making it the oldest object in our solar system.</p>

    <h3>Structure</h3>

    <p>The surface temperature of the Sun is 5,500°C on average, which is called the photosphere, since it emits the most light. The core is way hotter, being around 15,000,000°C, since the hydrogen has been fused to helium, with it being a lot more dense. The Sun has a radius of 696,340 km and a mass of 1.989 × 10^30 kg, being over 100 times larger than Earth, and weighing around 330,000 times more, taking up 99.8% of the solar system’s mass.</p>
    <h3>Lifespan</h3>
    <p>The Sun formed around 4.6 billion years ago from a molecular gas cloud. Though it seems very long, the Sun is expected that its current phase will only last for 5 billion more years until it will expand into a red giant and engulf the inner planets, possibly Earth. After 1 billion years of this phase, the Sun will cool down into a white dwarf – the remnant of the former red giant’s core, and after a final 10 billion years of this phase, the Sun will finally become a black dwarf – essentially a corpse of what was a star that emits no light at all. The lifespan of our Sun does seem short this way, but we have billions of years left in our solar system – way more than enough time for humanity to develop and expand to other stars, and even galaxies.</p>
    <h3>The Future</h3>
    <p>Since the Sun outgoes nuclear fusion, it generates astronomical amounts of energy – effectively unlimited for humanity until we rise to higher civilisation types on the Kardashev Scale. Megastructures such as Dyson spheres or swarms can be built to absorb the energy produced by our Sun.</p>
